#import "fa2.1-multi-asset.jsligo" "Contract"

// When this file was created, the smart contract was defined with an entrypoint using `@entry` that was within a namespace. As such, the examples below are written with that assumption in mind.

// IMPORTANT: We suggest always explicitly typing your storage values:
// E.g.: `const storage: int = 10` or `const storage: Contract.storage = 10`
