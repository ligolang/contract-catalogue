Add or Remove token operators for the specified token owners and token IDs.


The entrypoint accepts a list of update_operator commands. If two different
commands in the list add and remove an operator for the same token owner and
token ID, the last command in the list MUST take effect.


It is possible to update operators for a token owner that does not hold any token
balances yet.


Operator relation is not transitive. If C is an operator of B and if B is an
operator of A, C cannot transfer tokens that are owned by A, on behalf of B.
